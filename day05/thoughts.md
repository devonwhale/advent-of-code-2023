Some lovely parsing to do in this one. Shame about the hacky reverse brute force I did for part 2 but it runs in less than 5 minutes so I'll take it. I did originally play around with doing some clever stuff using `range` and dynamically generating them based on intersections, but I could feel that taking a while and my lunch break was coming to an end so thought I might as well throw togther something fire and forget that I could leave to run by itself
